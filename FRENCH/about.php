                <strong>What is this for?</strong>
                <p>
                French Revolution, although known to many that have taken interests in European History, does not have much publicity in the general population. That is, of course, in comparison to the much repeated history of the two Great Wars. However, it is important to know that the French Revolution is the one that sparked the idea of nationalism, and as a symbol of people’s power. Not only did it impact much of Europe in the 18th century, its effects still remanent to this very day. Ash Fall aims to induce public interests on the series of events that changed the dynamics of nationalism, as well as the struggles between the working classes, middle classes and that of Monarchy in 18th - 19th century Europe and how it affects today’s world.

There will be scenario for the player to experiences: each of the scenario will present the player with a short narrative or cinematic for its background story.

                <strong>What does it run on?</strong>
                <p>
    Ash Fall will be created as a web solution to provide entertainments and educational values for consumers with free time. Most of its control will be mouse/touch-based point and click, with the exception of imputing the player’s name at the title page. It is possible to have the game be running as long as you have access to a compatiable web browser.
