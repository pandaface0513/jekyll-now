                <strong>What is this for?</strong>
                <p>
                French Revolution, although known to many that have taken interests in European History, does not have much publicity in the general population. That is, of course, in comparison to the much repeated history of the two Great Wars. However, it is important to know that the French Revolution is the one that sparked the idea of nationalism, and as a symbol of people’s power. Not only did it impact much of Europe in the 18th century, its effects still remanent to this very day. Ash Fall aims to induce public interests on the series of events that changed the dynamics of nationalism, as well as the struggles between the working classes, middle classes and that of Monarchy in 18th - 19th century Europe and how it affects today’s world.

                <strong>What is it exactly?</strong>
                <p>
                Ash Fall is a role-playing game that is loosely based on historic acute sources to reflect the events happened during the French Revolution. During the game, the player will be playing as an imaginary figure that will witness the events evolving in 18th century France. There will be scenario for the player to experiences: each of the scenario will present the player with a short narrative or cinematic for its background story. Then the player will be given multiple choices, in the form of decision cards. In order to proceed, the player will require to make a decision based on his/her historical knowledge or rely on logical senses. If the player made a decision that isn’t true, then there will be explanation and a scene played out on why it didn’t happen. If the player made the correct choice, similar explanation will be presented and awards player for the correct choice.

                <strong>What does it run on?</strong>
                <p>
    Ash Fall will be created as a web solution to provide entertainments and educational values for consumers with free time. Most of its control will be mouse/touch-based point and click, with the exception of imputing the player’s name at the title page. It is possible to have the game be running as long as you have access to a compatiable web browser.

    Me. A student in a design program at Simon Fraser University in Canada by the name of Henry Lo. This is created firstly for a STEAM project in my history class. Later I could upgrade this to a history review tool.
