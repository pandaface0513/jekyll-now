title: Minecraft Virtual Gallery
---

### Design Concept:
This website is for a school group project. We had an Interactive Art Project for anti-bullying. The project was a community project, where people in the social media would donate their artworks and be put on the virtual gallery in the minecraft server.

The website features a full-screen video playing in the background. The idea is to show the audiences how the project looks like upfront. To create an immersive environment to visitors. The rest of the website follows a minimalistic design, where you could toggle on/off sections of the website.
